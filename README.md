RECOMMENDATIONS:

The best parental level of education for students which was some College certificate should continue to balance education and practical skills and parents should continue to be involved in their childrenâ€™s education, while those with Master degree being the worst level of parents should reduce overemphasis on academic achievement and not neglect their children emotional needs and as well not place unrealistic expectations on the children.
Group C with the top race ethnicity should continue to place high value on education, imbibe strong family support and expectations while Group A with the least race ethnicity should have access to quality educational resources, historical, systematic and language barriers should be checked as well.
The bottom writing score which was 73 can be greatly improved by encouraging and fostering a growth mindset towards writing and also be celebrating students writing achievements.
The lowest Math's score which was 65 can be significantly increased by emphasizing problem solving and critical thinking as well as providing opportunities for math exploration.   
The least reading score which was 72 can be improved by creating a reading rich environment for the students using visual aids and multimedia.
The test performance on course can be further increased by instilling regular reviews and practice of materials in students, administration of practice tests to simulate actual test experiences.
